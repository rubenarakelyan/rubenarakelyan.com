        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <h3>Senior Backend Engineer<br>Hopin<br>April 2021 – November 2022</h3>
        I was a Senior Backend Engineer, firstly on the Analytics team, building tools
        to provide event organisers with analytics and insights into their events in the
        form of reports, visualisations and statistics. I then moved to the Product
        Growth team to build new features and improvements to drive new customer
        acquisition and retention.

        I also worked on a number of internal cross-team technical improvement projects
        including moving apps to a new Kubernetes environment, upgrading frameworks
        and improving the CI environment.

        <h3>Lead Developer<br>Resolver<br>August 2019 – April 2021</h3>
        I was the Lead Developer at Resolver Group, working mainly on Accord ODR, a
        collaborative Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform for courts, tribunals,
        ombudsmen and alternative dispute resolution providers.

        I led a team of two developers and myself building Accord ODR as a SaaS platform
        on AWS with the latest technologies such as CI/CD, immutable containerised builds
        and serverless functions, using Ruby on Rails.

        I also had a high-level oversight of the other technical teams in the company
        building consumer-side and bespoke commercial applications.

        <h3>Lead Developer (GOV.UK)<br>Government Digital Service<br>November 2018 – July 2019</h3>
        I was the Lead Developer on GOV.UK, working with other senior technical leaders
        to help shape the technical future of the platform for the next two years.
        I worked on things that cross team and quarterly planning boundaries, the
        long-term strategic vision for the GOV.UK platform as well as people issues
        such as team planning, developer health and placements.

        I was also the link between the GOV.UK Platform Health team and the
        Reliability Engineering team migrating the platform to AWS and looking at
        containerisation of GOV.UK apps.

        I was an interviewer for junior technologist, developer and senior developer
        positions, and a line manager to two developers.

        <h3>Developer/Senior Developer/Technical Lead<br>Government Digital Service<br>July 2016 – November 2018</h3>
        I was a Developer on the Finding Things team, working on search and navigation
        across GOV.UK, including the development and initial roll-out of the new topic
        taxonomy.

        I helped host the first GDS capture-the-flag event and a full-day security
        workshop for developers.

        I was a Senior Developer working on services for British citizens abroad,
        the GOV.UK email subscription system and government organisational presences
        on GOV.UK.

        As a technical lead, I worked on email subscriptions across GOV.UK and the
        GOV.UK publishing platform as part of the Email team. I set the overall
        direction of the development team and oversaw strategic decisions about
        technologies and products, working with other team and technical leads to
        ensure consistency and quality. I also ensured the developers are happy and
        were meeting their own development goals.

        I was a member of the inaugural Shadow Board, providing scrutiny of and input
        to the GDS Management Team.

        <h3>Lead Developer<br>orderswift<br>May 2015 – June 2016</h3>
        I was the Lead Developer at orderswift, working on the core platform and product
        as well as connected applications and APIs. I built version 2 of the platform
        which was in use during the company's rapid expansion phase, powering online
        click-and-collect food ordering for large multi-site operators such as
        Ask Italian, Zizzi and Prezzo. The core platform is built on Laravel,
        Forge and DigitalOcean with Codeception for testing and various third-party
        API integrations with EPoS solutions and payment providers. Everything is
        managed using Git, and tracked with Mixpanel and New Relic.

        <h3>Business Analyst<br>Shell<br>November 2010 – May 2015</h3>
        I wrote all the documentation for the roll-out of SAP BusinessObjects Analysis
        and Dashboards to all Downstream businesses. I also trained and supported super
        users using this documentation. I was the focal point and subject matter expert
        for all support queries.

        I worked on the Insight programme, which provided monitoring, surveillance and
        reporting software for regulatory compliance for Shell Trading, including trade
        reporting to ESMA. I authored functional designs, worked with source system
        owners, and provided data analysis services for multiple legacy systems and
        third-party systems as well as leading defect management and troubleshooting.

        Finally, I was a Business Analyst on the Workspace Evolution programme
        investigating the introduction of Office 365 to all end users, including Office
        apps, Exchange, Lync, SharePoint, OneDrive and Yammer, as well as a consultant
        to a separate project, assisting with standards-based web application remediation
        and the introduction of IE 11.
