            I worked on two projects: SCPN (Submit Cosmetic Product Notifications) and PSD (Product Safety Database). SCPN is a database of cosmetic products marketed in the UK along with their compositions, used by manufacturers and others to notify cosmetic products and public sector users for health and safety purposes. PSD is a database of products of concern marketed in the UK, including those subject to recall, used by public sector users to control importation, sale and recall of unsafe or non-compliant products.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            As well as feature and maintenance work on both systems, I built the initial version of a support portal for SCPN and PSD to allow internal support teams to administer notifications and users. I also built PRISM, a tool within PSD to create risk assessments as well as a major overhaul of how notifications are created in PSD.
